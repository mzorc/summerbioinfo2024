# summerbioinfo2024

Navigating genetic diversity with bioinformatics

Course overview

Summer school will be held from 10-12th July 2024.

Location: Department of Animal Science, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
Groblje 3, 1230 Dom≈æale, Slovenia

Course aim

The aim of the summer school is to stimulate interest in animal science, genetics, biodiversity and bioinformatics among BSc and MSc students. We will present students with challenges in the field of preserving biodiversity in farm animals. The lectures, computer exercises and the presentation of the genetic laboratory will be designed so that the participants will gradually learn about the techniques we use today in the field of biodiversity research in domestic animals. We will introduce them to the work in the genetics laboratory and the basic bioinformatics methods we use to analyze genetic diversity (eg calculation of genetic-population parameters, analysis of population structure, assessment of the degree of inbreeding). The examples we will use in the summer school will be based on autochtonous animal breeds data.

Who is this course for?

Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their knowledge and skills further. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this course; group projects may give you the opportunity to learn basic programming, but participants will be supported in this by their mentors.

Participants

MBSc and MSc students.
